		<description><![CDATA[In the Roman Republic the Rubicon marked the boundary between the imperial provinces, where the Roman generals&#039; could do as they pleased, and Italia proper where law and order reigned. Julius&#039;s term as governer of Gaul had ended and he was supposed to return to Rome as a private citizen, but he enjoyed being supreme boss I think. By crossing the Rubicon with his army Caesar  was acting in defiance of the law and would face prosecution by the senate and possible execution.  By entering with his army he was essentially starting a civil war which would lead to either his death and the continuance of the Republic, or in the event that he was victorious, the destruction of the Republic and his ascent to the dictatorship. So it was all of nothing. Crossing the Rubicon he uttered the famous phrase &quot;alea iacta est&quot; - the die is cast, and so one of the biggest ego in history launched a bloody civil war that would eventually lead to his assasination and to the foundation of the Roman Empire by his nephew Octavian(Augustus) twenty years later.

If this is your metaphorical Rubicon, it means that you have passed the point of no return. You cannot come back Michael! Or is it the dictatorship you are after?]]></description>
